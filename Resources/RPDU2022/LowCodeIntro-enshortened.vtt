00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.666
<b>Welcome to the world of Low-Code!</b>

2
00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:05.833
<b>Imagine you are a business professional and you're</b>

3
00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:08.833
<b>required to keep track of key metrics for an important</b>

4
00:00:08.833 --> 00:00:10.699
<b>business using a spreadsheet.</b>

5
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:14.066
<b>Overtime the number of clients contributing to this process</b>

6
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:14.900
<b>grows.</b>

7
00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:18.100
<b>Continuously using spreadsheets to keep track of data</b>

8
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.100
<b>manually becomes increasingly inefficient.</b>

9
00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:24.133
<b>The obvious solution is to create an application that</b>

10
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:25.800
<b> handles your data for you. </b>

11
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:26.833
<b>However,</b>

12
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.666
<b>doing so takes time and would require a level of</b>

13
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:31.699
<b>programming knowledge which you may not have.</b>

14
00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.366
<b>How can you continue to keep track of important data </b>

15
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:38.266
<b>without slowing down your overall business process?</b>

16
00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.166
<b>The solution to this problem is to use a Low Code platform</b>

17
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:45.500
<b>to develop a software solution that makes it easy to submit,</b>

18
00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:46.399
<b>track</b>

19
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:49.233
<b>and import data quickly and efficiently.</b>

20
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:53.833
<b>In an always evolving and growing tech world, the tools </b>

21
00:00:53.833 --> 00:00:57.299
<b>and technologies available for development have skyrocketed.</b>

22
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:58.666
<b>As a result,</b>

23
00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:02.166
<b>development teams now need to manage complex environments,</b>

24
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:04.633
<b>rather than homogenous stacks that were</b>

25
00:01:04.633 --> 00:01:05.900
<b>common 20 years ago.</b>

26
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:09.400
<b>Today, some businesses require faster</b>

27
00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:11.799
<b>and more flexible solutions than</b>

28
00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:13.533
<b>custom code scripts could offer,</b>

29
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:15.799
<b>and this is where low code comes in.</b>

30
00:01:19.833 --> 00:01:22.833
<b>Low code is a minimal-coding approach</b>

31
00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:25.266
<b>to creating applications and processes</b>

32
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:29.333
<b>without needing to research, write, or test new scripts.</b>

33
00:01:30.033 --> 00:01:32.900
<b>Low code platforms are accessible to people of</b>

34
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.433
<b>all skill levels.</b>

35
00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:37.599
<b>This means that users who have never learned how to code  </b>

36
00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:40.599
<b>can develop an entire application on their own. </b>

37
00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:44.799
<b>Often, the result is obtained within days or weeks of</b>

38
00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.533
<b>the initial idea.</b>

39
00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:56.099
<b>Since low code does not require prior coding knowledge,</b>

40
00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:59.833
<b>non-IT professionals can create their own applications</b>

41
00:01:59.833 --> 00:02:02.466
<b>without needing constant communication with  </b>

42
00:02:02.466 --> 00:02:03.733
<b>a technical team.  </b>

43
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.166
<b>The minimal code style for creating applications </b>

44
00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:11.733
<b>leads to a much faster delivery of software solutions,</b>

45
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.900
<b>as well as increased flexibility in modifying them.</b>

46
00:02:16.566 --> 00:02:20.766
<b>Microsoft Power Apps and Power Automate are easy to use.</b>

47
00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:24.233
<b>There are many official tutorials and documentation</b>

48
00:02:24.233 --> 00:02:27.466
<b>available to explain basic and advanced tools </b>

49
00:02:27.466 --> 00:02:30.466
<b>provided by the Microsoft Power Platform.</b>

50
00:02:33.266 --> 00:02:36.133
<b>Low code simplifies the development process</b>

51
00:02:36.133 --> 00:02:38.833
<b>and frees up resources by allowing</b>

52
00:02:38.833 --> 00:02:41.466
<b>the automation of mundane tasks. </b>

53
00:02:49.166 --> 00:02:52.733
<b>The Rapid Prototype Design Unit currently offers licensing</b>

54
00:02:52.733 --> 00:02:55.533
<b>for Microsoft PowerApps and Power Automate platforms,</b>

55
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.800
<b>which in turn can easily integrate with Power BI solutions.</b>

56
00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:01.366
<b>Furthermore,</b>

57
00:03:01.533 --> 00:03:04.099
<b>you can add intelligence to the applications you build</b>

58
00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.366
<b>on the Power Platform using the AI Builder feature.</b>

59
00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:10.500
<b>In the future, we will be providing access</b>

60
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.000
<b>to additional platforms to help with building</b>

61
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
<b>low code applications.</b>
