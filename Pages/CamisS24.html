                involved developing software for park, campground, marina, and harbor employees to ensure Camis produced
                quality products for its clients.

            <p>
                I worked with my team to fix, maintain, and develop new features for Camis. As this term was a
                continuation from the previous four months, I tended to focus on contributing work rather than learning.
                There were still plenty of opportunities to learn and improve, which I took whenever I could.

            Camis is a company that provides government operated parks, marinas, and harbors with
            various park management solutions. The company provides its journey and history on <a

            These values apply with both external and internal work relating to the company. Externally, we aim to
            achieve what our clients ask for to the best of our abilities, with the highest possible quality.
            Internally, it encourages everyone to provide their ideas and try new approaches, all while maintaining best
            practices in our development. Camis aims to foster positive social and professional environments for its
            employees.

                    On the social side, Camis has a "Culture Club" which arranges events for Camis employees. There were
                    some virtual "game nights" that brought together employees from multiple locations to have fun.
                    There have also been simpler events, such as providing treats for Cinco de Mayo and birthdays every
                    month.

                    Towards the end of the coop work term, there was an in-person "olympics" event. The activities
                    included tent building (in which I competed with coops as a team) and rubber band shooting, among
                    others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While simple, making the effort to have such events fosters a positive attitude that feeds into the
                    professional work environment.

            During the summer term, some Camis employees started a patio garden. It's a somewhat simple activity as an
            amateur, but it also provides another opportunity for socialising with coworkers. At the start of the
            season, we planted tomatoes, basil, peppers, marigolds, and nasturtiums. We shared a weekly responsibility
            to keep the plants watered, and had small events to share what we grew with the rest of the office. One such
            event was making pesto with some basil (July 15, 2024), which we then shared with the office to enjoy.
        </p>
        <p>
            There have been a few other instances of simple choices that improve Camis' work environment. The platform
            used for day-to-day communication includes social channels. The existence of this platform and these
            channels makes it much easier to socialise (and even plan smaller events with coworkers).
        </p>
        <p>
            The aforementioned communication platform isn't just good for socialising. It is also an effective tool for
            collaboration. For example, reviewing work and pair programming are much easier to arrange (through an
            online call or in-person) when I can send a quick message to whoever I need. At times, I found that working
            in-person makes pair programming and troubleshooting issues much easier.
        </p>
        <p>
            Camis structures their teams such that, even as a software developer, I am aware of the goings-on on a
            broader scope than I would have expected. While it is not thorough or in-depth knowledge, I find that being
            aware of other projects and work that my coworkers are involved in gives me a better understanding of how
            Camis functions as a whole.

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="horizontal">
            <div class="vertical">
                <p>
                    So far, I have been a part of the software development life cycle, participated in the scrum agile
                    process, and collaborated with product development team members to develop new features.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the software development life cycle, I have worked with various languages and technologies to
                    create, fix, and maintain features in Camis' software. This includes languages such as C#, SQL, and
                    Typescript, and tools like .NET 6 and Git. I also touched on WPF from time to time, when editing
                    XAML files. The majority of these have been skills learned either on my own or on the job (be it a
                    past or current position).
                    <!-- I may have also worked with .NET Core and WPF, though I'm less sure due to their integration and use alongside other technologies. -->
                </p>
                <p>
                    The agile process is a given for most software-based companies. At Camis, I used Jira and Confluence
                    for ticket/task management and documentation respectively. We worked in two-week sprint cycles,
                    aiming to meet a goal each sprint. We had to multitask a few larger projects, so the choice of focus
                    would change each sprint as necessary.

                        The agile framework is popular in software-based companies.

        <h3>Day-to-Day</h3>
        <p>
            My team focused on software used by client staff (e.g. park staff). This included working on bugs, issues,
            new features, and improvements.
        </p>
        <p>
            I worked on two applications a majority of the time: Spirit and Sidekick. Spirit is a longer-standing
            application that manages anything that client staff would need, from selling products to managing bookings.
            Sidekick, on the other hand, is a mobile application meant to make on-site work easier, such as confirming
            that campers were at the appropriate (booked) campsite.
        </p>

        <!-- Highlight the most interesting or unique aspects of the job. -->
        <h3>Unique Parts of the Job</h3>
        <div class="horizontal">
            <p>
                I really appreciated the effort Camis put to documentation. While agile development focuses less on
                documentation in favour of speed, more often than not there was a resource available to learn and
                proceed with a given task. If I reached out for help, I was often given direction to existing resources
                that I may have struggled to find.
            </p>
            <div class="camis_border image_container">
                <figure>
                    <div id="center">
                        <div id="pen_and_paper_a">
                            <img id="pen_and_paper" src="/Resources/Other/pen-and-paper-svgrepo-com.svg">
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <figcaption>
                        Almost everything I encountered while working at Camis had some form of documentation.
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Once I started working more on Sidekick, there was less existing documentation. It seems that the relative
            newness and different approach to developing the project was a primary cause. So, in the process of adding
            my work to Sidekick, I also spent some extra time documenting anything new I learned relating to it. Even if
            I didn't have a <a href="#goal3">goal to provide further documentation</a> this term, I likely would have
            recorded what I could about Sidekick anyways. Resources often come in handy, after all.
        </p>

        <!-- What skills did you need for the job? Did you learn them in class or on the job? -->
        <h3>Skills on the Job</h3>
        <p>
            Skills that were necessary to perform well at Camis included clear communication, working on test coverage
            and unit testing, and reviewing changes to the code with the appropriate parties (including the user
            interface where necessary).
        </p>
        <h4> Clear communication</h4>
        <div class="special_horizontal">
            <div class="camis_border image_container_medium">
                <img class="icon" src="/Resources/Other/message-square-chat-svgrepo-com.svg" />
            </div>
            <p>
                Communication is a constant requirement, and it is something that I learned through both previous work
                terms and group projects. I have also, over time, developed my own methods of keeping records of my work
                to make communication as easy and effective as possible.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h4>Understanding test coverage and unit testing</h4>
        <p>
            Test coverage and unit testing go hand in hand, and they are a piece of knowledge I learned best in past
            coop positions where it was a requirement. I did have to learn new testing libraries (or at least refresh my
            memory), but once I had a decent understanding it wasn't too much trouble to add tests to the code I
            contributed to over the course of this work term.
        </p>
        <h4>Reviewing code</h4>
        <div class="horizontal">
            <p>
                Solution reviewing was somewhat new; it may have been a part of past work I've done, but with a
                different structure. Instead of checking the functionality of code, I would check in with the Product
                Owner, UX (User Experience) Designer, or Software Analyst on my team to verify the expected behaviour
                (also known as acceptance criteria). Once approved, I would then open a pull request on GitHub to check
                (and approve) the functionality of my code and merge it.

                    I'm regularly reviewing pull requests and my understanding of Camis software improves over the
                    course of my work term.

                    <p>
                        Previously, I wasn't added as a member of my team's review group. Once I was added, it became
                        easier to contribute to the reviewing process. My review actually felt relevant, rather than
                        being an "extra" review on a pull request.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is a challenge to contribute well to the review process; I'm not an expert in Camis software,
                        after all. Even with what I do know about the software, I often feel like there are others that
                        know the code better than I do.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While I am primarily focused on getting my own work done, I have taken advantage of lulls in my
                        own process (such as waiting for people to review my own pull requests) to review others' code.
                        I believe this has increased the amount of time spent on reviewing, which is good. It has also
                        kept me from taking on too many tickets at once; this is good, for times that my current tickets
                        end up requiring more work (or introduce new issues).

                    <p>
                        I rarely reviewed PRs to learn parts of Camis software, but I have looked at past commits and
                        merged PRs to learn/understand some portions of the software. This even contributed to creating
                        some documentation about Hot Chocolate object types and resolvers, which is linked below in <a
                            href="#goal3">my goal to continue documenting information for Camis</a>.

                    Evaluate tickets on whether they're familiar or new. Take on any that are unfamiliar but I feel I

                    I am able to take on larger/more complex tickets and complete them largely unaided (about a month or
                    two into my work term).

                    <p>
                        While I still hesitate to take on larger tickets, it isn't too difficult once I get started. It
                        seems like I have inadvertently taken on complex tickets before; the system Camis uses to
                        estimate tickets isn't always accurate, after all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The part of a larger ticket that makes me hesitate the most is my unfamiliarity with certain
                        aspects of Camis software. Since I don't know much about it, I have to first learn it before I
                        can make the necessary changes. This is where reaching out for help to get even an overview is
                        quite helpful, and members of my team have different niches of expertise around the work we do.
                        I also have access to past commits and PRs, which I have used as a reference and starting point
                        for learning more about Camis software and improving upon it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have been picking up tickets a bit slower this term. This is because I try to complete a
                        ticket as thoroughly as I can before moving on to another one. Since I've been doing that, I
                        believe my quality of work has improved. It has, as previously mentioned, also helped with
                        performing other tasks that don't directly involve coding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another reason I have been picking up tickets more slowly is because I am picking up
                        higher-complexity tickets. Since these tasks require more effort and attention, they naturally
                        take more time. Recently (early July), I picked up a few tickets in rapid succession. Upon
                        noticing this, I tried to slow my pace to avoid picking up too many at once. However, they were
                        lower-effort; each ticket could feasibly be completed within a day or less. That makes it
                        reasonable to be working on several at once (awaiting feedback from others before marking them
                        as completed).

                    There is more documentation created that is helpful and will stay with Camis even after I leave.

                        I learned early in the term that documentation I previously created has been used by my
                        supervisor (a member of my team) for setting up his development environment. This was a case
                        where I combined all the information and instruction I received into one document.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To improve the longevity and accessibility of my documentation, I moved most of it into my
                        team's workspace on Confluence. I also re-created blog posts for better visibility for other
                        developers. I expect that these will be positive changes, and that more developers in Camis will
                        be able to use my documentation in the long term.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As my knowledge becomes more specialised for working within Camis, it feels like it's becoming
                        harder to determine what requires documentation. My memory serves me well for working
                        efficiently, but I'm less sure of what came from Camis documentation and what came from
                        conversations with coworkers or independent investigation. I still aim to update any issues or
                        new information I encounter that has no existing documentation. (One such example is my
                        documentation on <a href="./Confluence_Pages/Object_Types_and_Resolvers">Hot
                            Chocolate object types and resolvers</a>.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have pivoted more towards documenting problems and potential solutions. This may involve
                        troubleshooting, but it may also be to make communication more effective in decision-making. For
                        example, I picked up a ticket with a somewhat low estimate, but turned out to be more complex
                        than anticipated. I created a document to share what the issues were, along with potential
                        solutions and suggestions on how to move forwards (such as creating new tickets for what
                        couldn't be completed).
