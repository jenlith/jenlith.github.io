                My work involved fullstack development and manual
                testing to ensure the company produced quality products for its clients. The variety
                of work I performed allowed me the opportunity to increase and expand my skills and
                knowledge in the workforce.

            NCR is the National Cash Register, a global Financial Technology (FinTech) company. The

            NCR focuses on providing its clients with a unified source for their data rather than
            the older siloed structure commonly found in banks. It also seeks to provide software as
            a service (SaaS) and develop versatile, useful tools to anyone interacting with the
            financial sector. Each customer is treated as if they're the only customer to ensure
            they receive the best services possible from NCR.
        </p>
        <div class="horizontal">
            <div class="vertical">
                <p>
                    Within the company, employees are given a positive, collaborative work
                    environment. Since NCR provides a hybrid structure, employees can work from home
                    if necessary and come to the office for more direct collaboration with their
                    teams. My impression from within NCR is that employees' attitudes and
                    productivity are improved with the ability to choose between working in-person
                    or remotely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    NCR fosters community by organizing events for the employees so that they can
                    socialize and get to know their coworkers within the office. They also provide
                    activities for more day-to-day socializing. During my time at NCR, I experienced
                    the positive results of these efforts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The social events provided by NCR allowed me more opportunities to meet and
                    interact with other employees and co-op students. I also volunteered for a
                    couple events: serving ice cream after the lunch hour and helping set up and
                    take down activities for the NCR barbecue. As I had to be in-person and work
                    with other employees, it allowed a more structured way of getting to know my
                    coworkers. Even after the events, I was able to keep socializing and getting to
                    know the people I had met.

                    multiple events NCR hosted to encourage socializing amongst employees.

        <p>
            Many of the employees at NCR are returnees, which shows that the company fosters a
            positive work environment. At least two of my team members were former University of
            Guelph students, and a few other employees I have spoken with started as contractors who
            eventually returned to NCR as full-time employees. There are also employees who have
            worked for NCR for a decade or more. NCR's positive environment encourages employees to
            return and continue to work for the company.

                    I will regularly access JIRA daily to practice using its tools (agile board,
                    Tempo timesheets, etc.) and learn its general functionality.

                <p>
                    I require little to no assistance through documentation or help from others to
                    perform basic tasks after 4-6 weeks.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While my lack of familiarity with JIRA made it intimidating to use, observing
                    others using JIRA and my own exploration allowed me to learn and adapt to
                    regularly using the tools within it. Such uses include tickets that document
                    stories for new features and bugs that require fixing, and recording time spent
                    working on those various tasks. By the end of six weeks (or sooner), I could use
                    JIRA quite well and knew how to update information as I needed across the
                    software.

                        I continued to investigate issues I encountered independently by trying
                        various solutions I could find or knew from other previously encountered
                        issues. After my independent investigation, I reached out to whoever I
                        thought would be most likely to either be able to help me or redirect me to
                        someone who could. I would also provide them with the solutions I tried so
                        that it would take less time to help me resolve my issues.

                        This approach worked well, and I used my time more efficiently as I learned
                        quick fixes or received the help I needed to handle any issues I
                        encountered.

                        find more on my own that have proven to be useful. I also learned how to use
                        various tools through debugging and adding new features to NCR's CSP Imaging

                        with my reasoning in case an issue were to reproduce itself.

                        I believe I accomplished my goal. Logging and fixing issues in the code
                        provided me with a less formal understanding of what to do before I
                        documented any new features. My team was also able to provide guidance to
                        ensure I documented any changes and issues properly.

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            My position started off with setting up my developer environment. Once I was set up, I
            handled a few bugs in the software as a way of familiarizing myself with the code
            structure. I also learned how to use the various tools NCR used, including JIRA and
            Confluence.

                    Passport is, as described, a remote deposit capture software. Instead of
                    physically depositing cheques, the software uses photos of the cheques to
                    deposit them into a bank user's account. This is to make the process of
                    depositing a cheque as convenient as possible.

            Our work focused on developing new features either anticipating future demands
            or in response to client-specific requests, and fixing any issues discovered
            either by clients or through our internal testing. For the most part, issues
            were found internally, so we were able to fix them before clients encountered
            them. As for new features, we would figure out how to add them into our existing
            software, then other team members would review our plan (and later, our
            implementation) to ensure our work wouldn't introduce any problems to the code.

        <h3>Unique Parts of the Job</h3>
        <p>
            While working at NCR, I found the workday to be both structured and flexible. With core
            hours, I could work around them as necessary for my personal needs. However, my work was
            still structured as I knew what tasks were assigned to me and the expectations of when I
            would complete them. This allowed my team and I to have an informal environment to
            assist each other as necessary and perform our work however we found best for ourselves.
        </p>
        <!-- What skills did you need for the job? Did you learn them in class or on the job? -->
        <h3>Skills on the Job</h3>
        <p>
            I learned several new tools and resources on the job. In general, I worked with JIRA and
            Confluence. JIRA is a software for logging and recording work done on development
            stories, bugs, or other tasks, while Confluence is a platform for creating, editing, and
            using documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a developer, I learned how to work in MyEclipse (an IDE) for development in Java. I
            also learned how to use ReactJS, a JavaScript library, for the first time. Since ReactJS
            is a popular resource, I also took some of my own time to learn more about it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alongside developing new features and fixing bugs, I also wrote unit tests using JUnit
            (for Java) and Jest with the React testing library (for JavaScript). The existence of
            these tools encouraged implementing tests that could prevent future developers from
            reintroducing bugs into the software.
        </p>
        <p>
            While working at NCR, I also worked on some test stories. These were manual tests
            written in HP ALM (Application Life Cycle Management), a software for testing
            stories/performing Quality Assurance (QA). I would read the test steps, then perform
            them. Whenever I encountered a situation where I got an unexpected result, I checked
            with other testers to confirm that what I found was indeed a bug and not a
            misconfiguration of the test environment on my part. In the cases where I had found
            bugs, I would then record each one as a JIRA ticket for developers to work on in the
            future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Learning all of these tools and resources was useful, since they each support agile
            development in its various stages. I also expect to encounter most of them again in the
            future.

                As a coop student working at NCR, I had a positive learning experience while
                contributing to actual products delivered to NCR's clients. My work was varied, and
                everyone in the Waterloo office supported and encouraged my participation in the
                work and social aspects of the company.
