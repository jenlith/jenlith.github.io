                involved developing software for park employees to ensure Camis produced quality

                    On the social side, Camis has a "Culture Club" which arranges events for Camis employees. There are
                    monthly virtual "game nights" that bring together employees from multiple countries to have fun.
                    There have also been simpler events, such as providing treats for Valentine's Day and Pi Day. While
                    simple, making the effort to have such events fosters a positive attitude that feeds into the
                    professional work environment.

                <p>
                    There have been a few other instances of simple choices that improve Camis' work environment. The
                    platform used for day-to-day communication includes social channels. The existence of this platform
                    and these channels makes it much easier to socialise (and even plan smaller events with coworkers).

            When it comes to working, I found that learning and asking for help were always encouraged. It's sometimes a
            challenge to ask for help, but I quickly adjusted to reaching out while working at Camis. I do not believe I
            was ever discouraged from asking questions, only redirected to the appropriate people who could help me.
        </p>

                <p>
                    The aforementioned communication platform isn't just good for socialising. It is also an effective
                    tool for collaboration. For example, reviewing work and pair programming are much easier to arrange
                    when I can send a quick message to whoever is necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Camis allows employees to work with a hybrid format. I appreciate the choice. It allows me to
                    continue to work and keep my coworkers healthy if I am feeling sick. For working in-person, I find
                    that it makes pair programming much easier.

            Camis structures their teams such that, even as a software developer, I am aware of the goings-on on a
            broader scope than I would have expected. While it is not thorough or in-depth knowledge, I find that being
            aware of other projects and work that my coworkers are involved in gives me a better understanding of how
            Camis functions as a whole. With this understanding, I think I was more patient whenever a teammate was less
            available to work with me on a given task.

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="horizontal">
            <div class="vertical">
                <p>
                    So far, I have been a part of the software development life cycle, participated in the scrum agile
                    process, and collaborated with product development team members to develop new features.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the software development life cycle, I have worked with various languages and technologies to
                    create, fix, and maintain features in Camis' software. This includes languages such as C#, SQL, and
                    Typescript, and tools like .NET 6 and Git.
                    <!-- I may have also worked with .NET Core and WPF, though I'm less sure due to their integration and use alongside other technologies. -->
                </p>
                <p>
                    The agile scrum process is a given for most software-based companies. At Camis, I used Jira and
                    Confluence for ticket/task management and documentation respectively. We worked in two-week sprint
                    cycles, aiming to meet a goal each sprint. We had to multitask a few larger projects, so the choice
                    of focus would change each sprint as necessary.

            In late February, my team participated in the initial work behind understanding and
            planning out the general work for a new feature, event ticketing. The majority of it
            would be entirely separate from existing features. This involved other teams, including
            product owners and UX (user experience) designers. Our work was meant to be somewhat
            broad, while covering as much technical areas as possible that would be necessary to
            meet product requirements.
        </p>

        <h3>Day-to-Day</h3>
        <p>
            My team focused on software used by park staff. This included bugs, issues, new
            features, and improvements.
        </p>
        <p>
            This meant working on two applications a majority of the time: Spirit and Sidekick. Spirit is a
            longer-standing application that manages anything that park staff would need, from selling products to
            managing bookings. Sidekick, on the other hand, is a mobile application meant to make on-site work easier,
            such as confirming that campers were at the appropriate (booked) campsite.
        </p>

        <h3>Unique Parts of the Job</h3>
        <div class="horizontal">
            <p>
                I really appreciated the effort Camis put to documentation. While agile development focuses less on
                documentation in favour of speed, I rarely found myself without a resource to learn and proceed with a
                given
                task. Typically, if I couldn't start or complete something, it was more due to the complexity of the
                work
                and my lack of familiarity with job-specific technologies than a lack of resources. If I reached out for
                help, I was often given direction to existing resources that I may have struggled to find.
            </p>
            <div class="vertical camis_border image_container">
                <figure>

                    <figcaption>
                        Almost everything I encountered while working at Camis had some form of documentation.
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            I have also been encouraged to document my own knowledge, which I hope contributes well to Camis. It was
            even <a href="#goal2">my goal to provide documentation</a>, since resources almost always come in handy. I
            include some examples of the documentation I wrote in that section.

        <!-- What skills did you need for the job? Did you learn them in class or on the job? -->
        <h3>Skills on the Job</h3>
        <p>
            Skills that were necessary to perform well at Camis included:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <!-- <li>Collaboration</li> -->
            <li>Clear communication</li>
            <li>Understanding test coverage and unit testing</li>
            <li>Solution reviewing (with the appropriate employee)</li>
            <!-- (with the Product Owner or User Experience (UX) designer) -->
            <!-- <li>A willingness to take on unfamiliar tasks</li> maybe? -->
        </ul>
        <div class="special_horizontal">
            <div class="camis_border image_container_medium">
                <img class="icon" src="/Resources/Other/message-square-chat-svgrepo-com.svg" />
            </div>
            <p>
                Communication is a constant requirement, and it is something that I learned through both previous work
                terms
                and group projects. I have also, over time, developed my own methods of keeping records of my work to
                make
                communication as easy and effective as possible.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            Test coverage and unit testing go hand in hand, and they are a piece of knowledge I learned best in past
            coop positions where it was a requirement. I did have to learn new testing libraries (or at least refresh my
            memory), but once I had a decent understanding it wasn't too much trouble to add tests to the code I
            contributed to over the course of this work term.
        </p>
        <div class="horizontal">
            <p>
                Solution reviewing was somewhat new; it may have been a part of past work I've done, but with a
                different
                structure. Instead of checking the functionality of code, I would check with the Product Owner, UX (User
                Experience) Designer, or Software Analyst on my team to verify the expected behaviour (also known as
                acceptance criteria). Once approved, I would then open a pull request on GitHub to check (and approve)
                the
                functionality of my code.

        <h3>Additional Topics Learned</h3>
        <a href="#nav">Back to top</a>
        <p>
            The structure of Camis seems to have helped me better understand the differences between each type of task I
            worked on.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, I better understand the difference between frontend and backend. While backend is defined as
            "server-side" and frontend as what the user sees, the definition wasn't always that clear to me in practical
            application scenarios. With the Sidekick project, the distinction between front and back end is much clearer
            and gave me a better understanding of how fullstack works in the "real world."
        </p>
        <div class="horizontal">
            <div class="vertical">
                <p>
                    I also have a better understanding of the variety of projects and tasks within the company. Making
                    changes to an application can either be a new feature, an improvement, or a fix for some bug or
                    issue encountered in existing code. Previously, I had a general understanding of the difference
                    between bug fixing and making changes. "Changes," however is a broad term, as it could be a fix or a
                    new addition. While working at Camis, I believe I better learned the differences because each
                    project is clearer about whether it's new, a change, or fixing some existing issue/bug than it has
                    been in my previous jobs.

                    I am able to perform expected tasks as quickly/easily as possible by the end of

                        There are a few different tools that can make development work easier. For the most part, I used
                        custom shortcuts, git stashes, and reference notes to improve my work speed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Windows (in my case, Windows 11 on my provided work computer) provides a method to create custom
                        shortcuts. I typically ran multiple C# projects simultaneously, sometimes from separate git
                        repositories. Since navigating folders to find the specific files/solutions was somewhat
                        time-consuming, I instead created shortcuts on my desktop. I hadn't done this before, but it was
                        surprisingly effective at helping me work faster.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The initial environment setup process included setting up a custom powershell. This provided
                        special commands made for Camis, which automated a majority of processes involved in developing
                        and testing the software locally. I took some time to learn what commands were provided by the
                        custom powershell, and it has definitely reduced the time taken on mundane or basic work for
                        certain builds or tasks I run regularly in my development environment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, I don't think I met the timeline I set for myself. Even during the month of
                        February, I felt like I was learning new tools that have since become useful. However, when I
                        reflected on this at the beginning of March, I did not think I fell too far behind my goal -
                        perhaps only a week or two at most.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Camis' products are, admittedly, a very large project. Even now I am still encountering new
                        sections that I have yet to fully engage with on a typical work day. Depending on which section
                        of the project I am working on, I will continue to encounter work that requires unique setups or
                        conditions to run correctly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my attempt at creating an efficient setup, I explored software that could provide custom
                        command keys. Unfortunately, software I looked into wasn't trusted/allowed on my work computer,
                        so I failed to implement anything of this type of tool.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On top of learning different commands and tools at my disposal, I also created reference files
                        for myself. These helped me with remembering helpful commands (for powershell and git) and
                        remember key details to include in my environment for specific setups.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For development environment setups, I took advantage of git stashes. By keeping the important
                        local changes in a stash, all I had to do was "apply" them to make several edits at once.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall, it would likely have been easier if I used and explored shortcuts more on my own
                        time before starting work here. However, I didn't do that, so I still consider what I have
                        achieved to be rather successful in improving my overall efficiency at work. After all, tools
                        and strategies can always be carried forwards into other situations and future employment.

                    I have created documentation that makes it faster to resolve environment-based issues or answer
                    questions about technical expectations to improve overall team performance.

                    <p>
                        Creating documentation has helped me, but I'm not sure if it's helped others as much. I don't
                        have any measures to track my coworkers' use of what I've created. I expanded beyond documenting
                        the onboarding process and basic development steps. Some of this included development
                        environment issues, or my review of larger pull requests from other developers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a personal reference for the development process used at Camis, my documentation has been a
                        useful tool to remind myself of each step, such as what is needed for solution reviews and pull
                        requests for a given task. Having notes on how to switch to different setups and handle any
                        issues that might arise from that has definitely helped me. There are specific challenges to
                        running each project within Camis, so having a reference to avoid missing any step in the setup
                        process is beneficial.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I documented my reviews of other developers' pull requests rather than providing direct
                        feedback because I wasn't always sure that what I noticed was a significant issue. By
                        highlighting them in this manner, I used my documentation as a sort of confirmation with my
                        team members on the existence, relevance, and severity of the issues I found. This meant that
                        unimportant items or non-issues were filtered out, so I consider this approach successful.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While my team may not use as much of my documentation as I hoped they would, I still believe
                        that what I created has been useful. I have certainly benefitted from it, and it leaves a record
                        of my work that may be repurposed in the future by my team if they so choose.

                    <p>
                        Seeing as some of my notes are applicable outside of Camis, I have decided to include some of
                        what I learned below. The observations may be specific to my experience at Camis, it is still
                        knowledge that can be applied to any project that uses the same tools and/or a similar
                        structure.

                        This is a goal I believe I have achieved, yet hope to improve upon. I am capable of gauging the
                        complexity of tickets (or tasks) relatively well, and I can determine which tickets I can work
                        on independently. An improvement would be reaching beyond what I currently know and continue to
                        learn more about the details of each project.

                        Pair programming was a rather effective method for learning quickly. While it started of as
                        guidance, pair programming was also a strong starting point to working independently on similar
                        tasks in the future. I hope to use this more often as a learning method.

                    <p>
                        Generally, working on specific tasks and software has helped me learn and speed up my
                        development process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes, I've had to step away from work or give up a ticket. While there were people on my
                        team that could have helped me, they also had their own work to do that made them unavailable to
                        help me at the time. These challenges, in my opinion, were often because I lacked a crucial
                        skill or piece of knowledge to be capable of working independently. If I encountered similar
                        challenges at a less busy time, I reached out for help. This has enabled me to learn more, such
                        as understanding Transact-SQL and how stored procedures work (both at Camis and in general).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I still feel like I perform the best on smaller tickets/tasks. I would like to build up to
                        higher-effort work, but I have a limited amount of knowledge as a co-op software developer. I
                        have learned plenty, but there is still more to learn, so I look forward to working at Camis for
                        another four months.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When it comes to tickets that focus on sections of Camis software I previously worked on, I'm
                        confident that my work speed has increased. There is less to learn, so it's easier to
                        investigate and fix any issues or add new features.

                        At the end of January, my team participated in an activity to create "reference stories." The
                        exercise allowed us to arrange previously completed tickets by their complexity and/or effort
                        involved, and then assign point values accordingly. This reference has helped me better estimate
                        the time I would spend on a ticket and gauge the complexity or effort involved in a ticket that
                        doesn't yet have a value assigned to it.

                        Being capable of taking initiative is important; it means I am not idle or neglecting any work.
                        With a combination of taking initiative and learning as I work, I can carry such knowledge
                        forward and into future employment.

            Working at Camis proved to be a wonderful work experience and learning opportunity. The collaboration within
            and between teams proved to be insightful. I was provided with a great environment to learn new skills and
            improve my existing abilities within the software development industry.
