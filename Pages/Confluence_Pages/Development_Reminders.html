      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        While a majority of development reminders were specific to Camis, I believe at least some of it is relevant to
        any software development position. Those topics are what I included here.

  <div id="dev_checklist">
    <h2>Development Checklist</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Have I updated the ticket to the appropriate status?
      </li>
      <li>
        Have I fixed the issue/made the improvement?
      </li>
      <li>
        Have I successfuly completed a solution review?
      </li>
      <li>
        Have I reviewed/written any relevant unit tests?
      </li>
      <li>
        Have I created a pull request?
      </li>
    </ul>

  <div id="ticket_etiquette">
    <h2>Ticket Etiquette</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Claim a ticket ("Assign to me") from the "To Do" column in Jira.
        <ul>
          <li>
            If a ticket is already claimed by another team member, ask for their permission to work on it first. (There
            may be a reason they've claimed it to work on, even if they haven't started it yet.)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Move the ticket to "In Progress" as soon as you start working on it. That way, others in your team are aware of
        what you're doing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Move the ticket to "Review" once the pull request and solution review are started.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div id="git_naming_conventions">
    <h2>Git Naming Conventions</h2>

    <h3>Branches</h3>
    <p>[ticket-ID]_[brief-title-or-description], e.g. XXXXX_Ticket-Name</p>

    <h3>Commits</h3>
    <p>
      Include the ticket ID & what you did, e.g. "XXXXX - Make particular change" as the commit title. You may use the
      commit body if you think a more in-depth description would be useful/helpful.
    </p>

    <div class="info">
      <p>
        If you accidentally make a commit to the wrong branch, but haven't pushed it to the remote branch, you can use
        <code lang="cmd">git reset HEAD~</code> to reverse the commit(s).
      </p>

  <div id="SR">
    <h2>Solution Review</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of a solution review is to show that the changes made to the code work as intended/expected. The
      person you do a solution review with depends on what the improvement/bug fix involves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The method of a solution review depends on complexity:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Simple/basic change: a screenshot or short video shared with the pull request on GitHub</li>
      <li>Complex/detailed change: video call with whoever should be involved in the solution review</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div id="PR">
    <h2>Pull Request (PR)</h2>
    <p>
      If there are any failures with the automatic steps involved in a PR, review them and make any changes you can to
      fix the issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it takes a while to get a PR approved by reviewers, feel free to ping/tag the appropriate user(s) on the
      appropriate platform(s).
