        Since we <u>didn't use Redux Toolkit</u>, we had to go more in-depth with our code and make sure that, when
        looking for resources, we weren't trying anything specific to Redux Toolkit. I went over parts 1-3 of <a
          href="https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-1-overview">Redux Fundamentals</a> as a way of
        getting a better grasp on how exactly Redux works.

  <div id="types">
    <h2>Types</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on what changes you want to make to the structure of the state, you may have to introduce a new type. I
      wanted to create a dictionary, so I created the following interface:
    </p>
    <pre><code lang="TypeScript">    export interface customDictionary {
      [key: number]: someData[];
    }</code></pre>
    <p>
      This is a relatively simple structure. The key would be something unique, which would then hold a list of some
      data specific to that key. I used a similar custom dictionary as a reference.
    </p>

  <div id="hooks_reducers_actions">
    <h2>Hooks, Reducers, Actions</h2>
    <p>
      React components would call hooks to interact with Redux. For my example, let's call the hook useSomeData.tsx. The
      related .reducers.ts and .actions.ts files (someData) had to be modified alongside this. Or rather, when I changed
      the reducers and actions, I had to update the hook.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would say these changes are rather straightforward. It's not that implementing the changes is simple, but rather
      that once you understand and know what you want to change, you should be able to do so successfully. Looking at
      relevant (and similar work) helped me understand how everything works together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since I introduced a dictionary, I had to understand how to change a value within an array in Redux. Thankfully, I
      had a pull request and a simpler example in Stack Overflow to reference (<a
        href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35628774/how-to-update-single-value-inside-specific-array-item-in-redux"
        target="_blank">How to update a single item inside a specific array in redux</a>).

  <div id="components">
    <h2>Components</h2>
    <p>
      Now for the React components that call the hook you changed. For the most part, this is making any necessary
      changes to eliminate errors you introduced. You may have to change variable types or parameters to methods, but
      it's pretty logical.
