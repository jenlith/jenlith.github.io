        <h1>Internet Accessibility</h1>
        <p>
            What makes internet accessibility so important? There's more than one reason,
            along with anecdotal evidence that making things accessible improves everybody's
            experience on the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            I started off with very little experience in frontend development when I started with
            the <a href="/Pages/rpduS22.html">Rapid Prototype Design Unit (RPDU)</a>, but I learned
            plenty through resources the Ontario Public Service (OPS) provided to software developers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Personally, I have found and heard multiple reasons for why making the internet accessible
            is something businesses should consider and strive for. They include (in no particular order):
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improving reading experience</li>
            <li>Increasing the number of people within a potential target audience</li>
            <li>Complying with accessiblity laws</li>
            <li>Standardising user experience across the internet (so that sites are intuitive and easier to use)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Improving Reading Experience</h2>
        <p>
            Now this one is perhaps an unusual highlight. However, when I found myself reading articles
            provided by people and groups that focused on accessibility, they were more comfortable for
            me. Perhaps it's eye strain from spending long hours in front of the computer or a
            farsightedness in development, but I find that larger-than-usual text (for example, 16-to-20pt
            font size instead of 12pt or 14pt) 'spaces' information out in such a way that I am unbothered
            by any potential text density.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe a larger font size is typically made with people with poor or limited vision in mind,
            but it helps even someone with normal vision. Neurodivergent people would also benefit from a
            larger text size for the aforementioned 'spacing' of information.
            (You can <a href="https://www.neurodiversityhub.org/what-is-neurodiversity">
                learn about neurodiversity from Neurodiversity Hub
            </a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            If people benefit from larger text and no one experiences challenges from it, why not use it?
        </p>

        <h2>Increasing the number of people within a potential target audience</h2>
        <p>
            As mentioned with the reading experience, people benefit from a larger text. Have you ever
            encountered a site where you click on it, only to leave immediately because it's impossible
            to read what you wanted to find?
        </p>
        <p>
            This happens more frequently with people who require accessibility in some form to access and 
            use the internet. Screen readers, navigation using a keyboard, and increasing the text size are 
            a few examples of needs users might have to explore the internet.
        </p>

        <h2>Complying with accessiblity laws</h2>
        <p>
            It seems obvious, but it isn't standard. Accessibility laws either should or do include the
            internet. With the work force and employment searching taking place online, through all this
            technology, it should be usable by everyone, right? Well, that would include people with physical
            and/or cognitive challenges. Therefore, sites should be accessible - which means complying with
            accessibility laws of the country they are based in.
        </p>
        <p>
            Better yet, the <a href="https://wcag.com/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a> 
            could be followed to make the internet (or, at least, as many sites as possible) accessible to everyone.
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Content_Accessibility_Guidelines">
                Wikipedia lists countries with a legal obligation to comply with the WCAG
            </a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Standardising user experience across the internet (so that sites are intuitive and easier to use)</h2>
        <p>
            Buttons and links are a highlight to this point. Standardising what a button or a link does 
            (and notifying the user if an action will navigate them away from the current page) makes it 
            easier and more comfortable for a user to interact with a given website.
