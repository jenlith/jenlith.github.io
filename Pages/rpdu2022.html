            <p>
                From May to December 2022, I worked in the Rapid Prototype Design Unit (RPDU) within the Ontario Public
                Services (OPS). My work was primarily on low code applications, though there were also some custom code
                projects.

            <h2>
                About the Employer
            </h2>
            <!-- Briefly Describe the employer & area of computing science that is related to
            this company/agency. Include interesting facts about the employer (people,
            locations, products, etc.) -->
            <div id="section_body" class="horizontal">
                <p>
                    The RPDU is a unit within the OPS, under the Ministry of Public and Business Service Delivery
                    (MPBSD)
                    (formerly the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services). The purpose of the unit is to deliver
                    prototypes and applications using low code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Low code" is a method of minimising the use of code when developing an application. It simplifies
                    the
                    process so that people with little or no experience with code can create their own application. For
                    more
                    experienced developers, it can be simpler to connect various resources together to create a more
                    complex
                    application.
                    <br />
                    In the RPDU, many applications were developed using this low code approach, using the resources and
                    tools
                    provided by the
                    <a href="https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/en-ca/">
                        Microsoft Power Platform (external site)
                    </a>.
                    Some examples of low code use include a World Cup charity "betting" application and an "eSignature"
                    application (Drop the Pen). Both applications take advantage of low code for rapid development with
                    the
                    user
                    interface (UI, Power Apps) and backend functions (Power Automate, Dataverse).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite being a primarily remote position, much of the work was collaborative and I ended up
                    enjoying my
                    time working with my colleagues and getting to know them while I worked in the RPDU. Regular
                    meetings
                    encouraged collaboration and helping each other as we worked.
                </p>
                <!-- 
            <p>
            Outside of the typical work expecations, the RPDU encouraged co-op students to develop their GitHub profiles
            and personal portfolios to help improve their standings in applying for future jobs. There were also
            multiple events with a similar purpose that took place in the larger Enterprise Technology Delivery (ETD)
            Division.

                                Why: More work than anticipated, but still communicated and took client's ideas in mind while developing the app
                            Challenges: Hard to be in touch when the client is busy a lot of the time. Communication improved nearer the deadline (due to client anticipation)

                                When developing in low code, there can be some technical difficulties with the "layering" of the custom-code-made 
                                    platform that the app is built in low code on top of. However, it is much easier to develop apps quickly since 
                                    code writing is reduced (lots of click & drag, less thought put towards code logic/organisation)

                            <br />
                            I consider this successful, as I continued daily standup meetings to stay on top of what
                            needed to be worked on in the website. I also used that time to offer to help others
                            where they needed assistance as I neared completion of what I took responsibility for.
                            That way, I avoided having idle time that could be used more effectively.

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                The primary goal for the RPDU was to quickly develop and prototype applications within the OPS using
                Microsoft Power Platform and custom code stacks. The unit is also the primary advocate for the use of
                low
                code in professional development, so we were also responsible for providing low code services and
                resources
                within the OPS to empower others to develop low code applications of their own.

                        <li>
                            The World Cup "betting" application, which was built on the Microsoft Power Platform as a
                            low
                            code
                            application, inspired by and partly based on a previous custom code application; and

                        <li>
                            The RPDU Portal and Intake service, a website using a custom code stack. The 'framework'
                            used
                            was
                            Blazor, which has an HTML frontend and C# backend. We used a Microsoft SQL server database
                            for
                            storing
                            information.

                        In the winter term, I took on other projects and responsibilities that other students left at
                        the end of their work term. These included:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Drop the Pen! an "eSignature" application, built on the Microsoft Power Platform much like
                            the
                            World
                            Cup
                            application. Most of my work included refining the user interface and experience, as well as
                            adding
                            some
                            extra features absent from the initial creation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            CrowdFundIT, a custom code website for various groups in the OPS to help fund and support
                            potential
                            ideas shared by other OPS employees. The original site was created as part of an OPS
                            hackathon,
                            and
                            therefore changed hands multiple times. It took time to learn the custom code (MVC 5, .Net
                            4.7)
                            and
                            understand the parts of the site already built by previous developers.
                            <!-- and plenty of exploring the site and studying the already-made code to understand every aspect of it. -->

            </div>
            <!-- Highlight the most interesting or unique aspects of the job. -->
            <h3>Details of the Job</h3>
            <p>
                Low code seems to be a newer method of development. It is also my first time encountering and working
                with
                it, so I found that to be interesting and fun to explore. I enjoyed creating things quickly and easily,
                ready to change a design or element at a moment's notice.
            </p>
            <p>
                All projects that I worked on were entirely internal, to contribute in some way to the working body of
                the
                OPS. Some were practical, such as Drop the Pen and the Portal/Intake service. They would help save time
                and
                organise information for employees. Others were inter-employee support, such as the CrowdFundIT. The
                World
                Cup application was aimed towards encouraging donations for charity with entertainment among employees.
            </p>
            <p>
                Co-op students were assigned to projects in a way that aimed towards having us learn on the job. Even
                though
                I didn't have experience with parts of the projects I worked on, I still learned how to work on said
                parts.
                I enjoyed this, as I felt more confident to try and figure things out as I worked on the project, even
                if I
                wasn't sure I could do it at first. I was also more ready to problem-solve whenever encountered an
                error.
            </p>
            <!-- What skills did you need for the job? Did you learn them in class or on the job? -->
            <h3>Skills on the Job</h3>
            <p>
                Problem-solving has been something I had to learn throughout my academic terms, and continued to
                utilise. I
                used Microsoft documentation and forums to figure out issues I encountered with the Power Platform, and
                Stackoverflow whenever I had to resolve a custom code issue.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the technical side, I learned more languages, which were either similar to languages I previously
                knew
                from classes (C#, javascript), or were relatively straightforward to understand as I used them (HTML,
                CSS).
            </p>
            <p>
                Web development was new, so I learned how to create a website on the job. The OPS uses the Ontario
                Design
                System to standardise the appearance of OPS apps and websites, so I worked within a standard guideline.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alongside the web development, I learned about accessibility standards for the internet. They are
                something
                I encountered and learned about for the first time on the job. These are technical guidelines and rules
                to
                improve the user experience for users with disabilities (physical or mental). They are known as the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Content_Accessibility_Guidelines">
                    Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (Wikipedia article)
                </a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though I have worked on group projects in class, I believe I continued to learn more communication and
                collaboration skills on the job. All projects involved a team of four to six people, so I had to make
                sure I
                could communicate my ideas properly as well as understand and implement my coworkers' ideas.
                <br />
                This job also involved communicating with clients, which included presenting completed work and taking
                notes
                on client feedback to implement it.
                <br />
                Overall, collaboration and communication is something that I find to be a continuous learning process.
                Using
                these skills whenever possible help improve them - practice is always useful.

                As a first co-op experience, this was a good starting point. The employer was supportive of the co-op
                students gaining experience and learning new skills. At the same time, I worked on multiple applications
                that will be and are used in real-world scenarios.
