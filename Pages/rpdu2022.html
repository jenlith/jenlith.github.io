        <p>
            From May to December 2022, I worked in the Rapid Prototype Design Unit (RPDU) within the Ontario Public
            Services (OPS). My work was primarily on low code applications, though there were also some custom code
            projects.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h2 id="about_employer">
            About the Employer
        </h2>
        <!-- Briefly Describe the employer & area of computing science that is related to
            this company/agency. Include interesting facts about the employer (people,
            locations, products, etc.) -->
        <p>
            The RPDU is a unit within the OPS, under the Ministry of Public and Business Service Delivery (MPBSD)
            (formerly the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services). The purpose of the unit is to deliver
            prototypes and applications using low code.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Low code" is a method of minimising the use of code when developing an application. It simplifies the
            process so that people with little or no experience with code can create their own application. For more
            experienced developers, it can be simpler to connect various resources together to create a more complex
            application.
            <br />
            In the RPDU, many applications were developed using this low code approach, using the resources and tools
            provided by the
            <a href="https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/en-ca/">
                Microsoft Power Platform (external site)
            </a>.
            Some examples of low code use include a World Cup charity "betting" application and an "eSignature"
            application (Drop the Pen). Both applications take advantage of low code for rapid development with the user
            interface (UI, Power Apps) and backend functions (Power Automate, Dataverse).
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite being a primarily remote position, much of the work was collaborative and I ended up enjoying my
            time working with my colleagues and getting to know them while I worked in the RPDU. Regular meetings
            encouraged collaboration and helping each other as we worked.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
            Outside of the typical work expecations, the RPDU encouraged co-op students to develop their GitHub profiles
            and personal portfolios to help improve their standings in applying for future jobs. There were also
            multiple events with a similar purpose that took place in the larger Enterprise Technology Delivery (ETD)
            Division.

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            The primary goal for the RPDU was to quickly develop and prototype applications within the OPS using
            Microsoft Power Platform and custom code stacks. The unit is also the primary advocate for the use of low
            code in professional development, so we were also responsible for providing low code services and resources
            within the OPS to empower others to develop low code applications of their own.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the summer term, I worked on two projects:
        <ul>
            <li>
                The World Cup "betting" application, which was built on the Microsoft Power Platform as a low code
                application, inspired by and partly based on a previous custom code application; and
            </li>
            <li>
                The RPDU Portal and Intake service, a website using a custom code stack. The 'framework' used was
                Blazor, which has an HTML frontend and C# backend. We used a Microsoft SQL server database for storing
                information.
                <!-- double check *what* Blazor is, and info about what we used to build the site: Blazor is a Single Page Application development framework. 
https://blazor-university.com/overview/what-is-blazor/
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor -->
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        In the winter term, I took on other projects and responsibilities that other students left at the end of their
        work term. These included:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Drop the Pen! an "eSignature" application, built on the Microsoft Power Platform much like the World Cup
                application. Most of my work included refining the user interface and experience, as well as adding some
                extra features absent from the initial creation.
            </li>
            <li>
                CrowdFundIT, a custom code website for various groups in the OPS to help fund and support potential
                ideas shared by other OPS employees. The original site was created as part of an OPS hackathon, and
                therefore changed hands multiple times. It took time to learn the custom code (MVC 5, .Net 4.7) and
                understand the parts of the site already built by previous developers.
                <!-- and plenty of exploring the site and studying the already-made code to understand every aspect of it. -->
                <!-- Double check info -->
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <!-- Highlight the most interesting or unique aspects of the job. -->
        <h3>Details of the Job</h3>
        <p>
            Low code seems to be a newer method of development. It is also my first time encountering and working with
            it, so I found that to be interesting and fun to explore. I enjoyed creating things quickly and easily,
            ready to change a design or element at a moment's notice.
        </p>
        <p>
            All projects that I worked on were entirely internal, to contribute in some way to the working body of the
            OPS. Some were practical, such as Drop the Pen and the Portal/Intake service. They would help save time and
            organise information for employees. Others were inter-employee support, such as the CrowdFundIT. The World
            Cup application was aimed towards encouraging donations for charity with entertainment among employees.
        </p>
        <p>
            Co-op students were assigned to projects in a way that aimed towards having us learn on the job. Even though
            I didn't have experience with parts of the projects I worked on, I still learned how to work on said parts.
            I enjoyed this, as I felt more confident to try and figure things out as I worked on the project, even if I
            wasn't sure I could do it at first. I was also more ready to problem-solve whenever encountered an error.
        </p>
        <!-- What skills did you need for the job? Did you learn them in class or on the job? -->
        <h3>Skills on the Job</h3>
        <p>
            Problem-solving has been something I had to learn throughout my academic terms, and continued to utilise. I
            used Microsoft documentation and forums to figure out issues I encountered with the Power Platform, and
            Stackoverflow whenever I had to resolve a custom code issue.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the technical side, I learned more languages, which were either similar to languages I previously knew
            from classes (C#, javascript), or were relatively straightforward to understand as I used them (HTML, CSS).
        </p>
        <p>
            Web development was new, so I learned how to create a website on the job. The OPS uses the Ontario Design
            System to standardise the appearance of OPS apps and websites, so I worked within a standard guideline.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alongside the web development, I learned about accessibility standards for the internet. They are something
            I encountered and learned about for the first time on the job. These are technical guidelines and rules to
            improve the user experience for users with disabilities (physical or mental). They are known as the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Content_Accessibility_Guidelines">
                Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (Wikipedia article)
            </a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Though I have worked on group projects in class, I believe I continued to learn more communication and
            collaboration skills on the job. All projects involved a team of four to six people, so I had to make sure I
            could communicate my ideas properly as well as understand and implement my coworkers' ideas.
            <br />
            This job also involved communicating with clients, which included presenting completed work and taking notes
            on client feedback to implement it.
            <br />
            Overall, collaboration and communication is something that I find to be a continuous learning process. Using
            these skills whenever possible help improve them - practice is always useful.
