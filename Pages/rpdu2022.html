                    From May to December 2022, I worked in the Rapid Prototype Design Unit (RPDU) within the Ontario
                    Public Services' (OPS) Ministry of Public and Business Service Delivery (MPBSD), formerly the
                    Ministry of Government and Consumer Services. My work was primarily on low code applications though
                    there were also some custom code projects. I created applications dedicated to increasing
                    productivity and convneience, as well as encouraging employee engagement.

                        The RPDU is a unit within the OPS, under the MPBSD. The purpose of the unit is to deliver
                        prototypes and applications using low code.

                "Low code" is a method of minimising the use of code when developing an application. It simplifies
                the process so that people with little or no experience with code can create their own application.
                For more experienced developers, it can be simpler to connect various resources together to create a
                more complex application.

                        In the RPDU, many applications were developed using this low code approach, using the resources
                        and tools provided by the <a href="https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/en-ca/">Microsoft Power
                            Platform (external site)</a>. Some examples of low code use include a World Cup charity
                        application and an "eSignature" application (Drop the Pen). Both applications take advantage of
                        low code for rapid development with the user interface (UI, Power Apps) and backend functions
                        (Power Automate, Dataverse).

                        Despite being a primarily remote position, much of the work was collaborative and I ended up
                        enjoying my time working with my colleagues and getting to know them while I worked in the RPDU.
                        Regular meetings encouraged collaboration and helping each other as we worked.

            Outside of the typical work expecations, the RPDU encouraged co-op students to develop their GitHub profiles
            and personal portfolios to help improve their standings in applying for future jobs. There were also
            multiple events with a similar purpose that took place in the larger Enterprise Technology Delivery (ETD)
            Division.

                                Why: More work than anticipated, but still communicated and took client's ideas in mind while developing the app
                            Challenges: Hard to be in touch when the client is busy a lot of the time. Communication improved nearer the deadline (due to client anticipation)

                                term team created several pages, as well as a Microsoft SQL database containing
                                information in multiple tables. Regular meetings with our client - our supervisor - kept
                                us focused on his wishes as we worked. The team for the fall term worked to refine the
                                website to ensure it is accessible and well-organised.

                                around halfway complete (or more) at the end of the summer term. The team met relatively
                                regularly with our busy client (Scott Bolton, the CIO of the ETD Division) and quickly
                                adopted any changes he requested from us. Our first launch of the application was
                                October 27, 2022. It was a day later than our goal due to unexpected technical issues,
                                but my team and I quickly fixed them to be on time. Our client's requirements for the
                                application turned out to be more work than anticipated, yet we were able to stay on
                                track and deliver a decent product.

                                of feedback. Despite the quantity, the low code nature of the application allowed us to
                                make changes quickly and update it in a timely manner for the users.

                        One challenge in consulting and communcating with the client for a given project was simply that
                        the client was busy. After all, they had their own work along with supervising and communicating
                        with other projects. This meant that taking notes was more important, so that my teams could
                        stay on track without constantly discussing a project with the client. Whenever I met with a
                        client, I made sure to record any important details and share it with my team so that we were
                        all on the same page.

                        Keeping up communication with a client and following their wishes is a key element in any work
                        environment. Even if a person is not a "client," as in a person outside of a team working on a
                        project, but rather a superior or team member, any use of communication is beneficial to other
                        potential scenarios. I found that this practice helped me develop and improve skills for
                        communication. In my experience, the important skills are quick, clear note-taking and
                        clarifying any confusion as soon as possible.

                                Low code can be limiting when trying to perform more complex tasks.
                                When developing in low code, there can be some technical difficulties with the "layering" of the custom-code-made 
                                    platform that the app is built in low code on top of. However, it is much easier to develop apps quickly since 
                                    code writing is reduced (lots of click & drag, less thought put towards code logic/organisation)

                        I did not meet my goal in the timeline I gave myself. However, as mentioned previously, my team
                        for the World Cup application delivered the product on October 27, 2022 and completed all its
                        related activities on December 19, 2022 (a day after the World Cup ended). I consider this goal
                        moderately successful, since I used both Power Apps and Power Automate for a project that was
                        used in a real-world situation (employee engagement).

                    <p>
                        Additionally, as a combination between custom and low code, I used Power Automate for a part of
                        the Portal and Intake Service project. It was a Power Automate flow that started whenever a
                        specific Microsoft Form received a new submission and updated a Microsoft SQL database table.

                            Occasionally, low code was challenging to work with due to its limitations when performing
                            more complex tasks. However, the complexity of these tasks were due to their specificity
                            rather than a lack of versatility in the low code. Each challenge had either a solution or a
                            work-around while using the low code platform.

                        Being able to use a new tool - low code - with no experience before my work term is a useful

                        has added new tools that I can bring to future work placements, along with demonstrating my

                                to date. We also kept in touch throughout the day over Slack, a messaging application.
                                Meeting virtually helped to clarify any confusion or miscommunication we experienced; we
                                were able to stay on the same page for our work. Sometimes, due to the differences in
                                understanding, I adapted how I communicated by either rephrasing myself and others or
                                using other mediums, such as drawing. In that same vein, we used Miro and Figma to
                                present our ideas visually to each other and keep a record of this communication.

                                There were several requirements for the portal's content. However, beyond certain
                                elements, the appearance could be arranged by the members of the team. Early on, while
                                we were still creating new pages, we used Figma to design multiple options for a given
                                page. We also used Miro a few times to make sure we logically organised content on
                                appropriate pages.

                        a professional setting. Here in the RPDU, we did not follow the exact structure of agile
                        developement. However, we followed the principle of developing our project as quickly as we
                        could, while frequently reviewing our goals so that we could change our trajectory as necessary.
                        These two elements are the fundamental points of agile development.

                        staying on-track on a project with my colleagues: meeting daily. Even if we didn't meet every
                        single day in a live meeting, we kept each other up to date through Slack (a messaging
                        application). I also kept notes that I could share with my colleagues so that any work we had to
                        do wouldn't be forgotten.

                                Shared notes from past term with students and did my best to make them logical
                                Met regularly and helped them out when I could. (Giving more resources, helping find solutions to their issues)
                                Colleagues still ask me questions when they need :)

                    <!-- </p> -->
                    <p>
                        As a student with an extended work term, I met several new students. While we transitioned into
                        becoming a new team, I made sure to make myself available to the new co-op students to help them
                        out whenever they needed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In general, if a student asked questions, I would either give them advice on how to approach
                        their issue to find a solution, or I would provide them with tips and links for problems I
                        recognised. If I didn't recognise the issue, I would look into it myself to see if I could find
                        a solution or process to help them out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the students joined teams, I provided them with resources if I was a part of a given team.
                        That way, they would have an easier transition into working on the project than if they had to
                        figure things out on their own.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is a goal I consider complete, as students still approach me for assistance when they need.
                        They are definitely experienced on their own, but they also use other people for assistance, as
                        it should be in a collaborative work environment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On top of helping current students, I have done my best to document what I can on the projects I
                        worked on. I believe it is good to provide as thorough of an overview as possible to give future
                        employees, student or otherwise, a decent starting point to continue work I contributed to. It
                        will also help in extending everyone's knowledge when they have a good base to build from.

                        All these practices demonstrate my capabilities in being approachable, helping others, and being
                        resourceful.

                The primary goal for the RPDU was to quickly develop and prototype applications within the OPS using

                low code in professional development, so we were also responsible for providing low code services and

                            used was Blazor, which has an HTML frontend and C# backend. We used a Microsoft SQL
                            server database for storing information.

                    In the fall term, I took on other projects and responsibilities on top of my existing ones. These
                    were projects that other students left at the end of their work term. These included:

                            Drop the Pen! an "eSignature" application, built on the Microsoft Power Platform much
                            like the World Cup application. The app is deseigned to make electronically signing
                            documents easier and more accessible. Most of my work involved refining the user interface
                            and experience. I also added some extra features absent from the initial creation.

                            CrowdFundIT, a custom code website for groups within the OPS to help fund and support
                            potential ideas shared by other OPS employees. The original site was created as part of an
                            OPS hackathon, and therefore changed hands multiple times. It took time to learn the custom
                            code (MVC 5, .Net 4.7) and understand the parts of the site already built by previous
                            developers.
                            <!-- and plenty of exploring the site and studying the already-made code to understand every aspect of it. -->

                    I explored the site from the user perspective and analysed the code to better understand
                    what I was working with. While documenting what I found, I worked with my team to minimise
                    any repetition in the code and implement better coding practices. One such change was using
                    a viewmodel between an entity (the 'code version' of a table) from the database and a view
                    (which is a page the user sees). It took some time and even modifying the database tables,
                    but the result is improved code to work with.

                        Low code seems to be a newer method of development. It is also my first time encountering and
                        working with it, so I found that to be interesting and fun to explore. I enjoyed creating things
                        quickly and easily, ready to change a design or element at a moment's notice.

                All projects that I worked on were entirely internal, to contribute in some way to the working
                body of the OPS. Some were practical, such as Drop the Pen and the Portal/Intake service. They
                would help save time and organise information for employees. Others were inter-employee support,
                such as the CrowdFundIT. The World Cup application was aimed towards encouraging donations for
                charity with entertainment among employees.

            <p>
                Co-op students were assigned to projects in a way that aimed towards having us learn on the job. Even
                though I didn't have experience with parts of the projects I worked on, I still learned how to work on
                said parts. I enjoyed this, as I felt more confident to try and figure things out as I worked on the
                project, even if I wasn't sure I could do it at first. I was also more ready to problem-solve whenever
                encountered an error.

            <h3>Skills on the Job</h3>
            <p>
                Problem-solving has been something I had to learn on my own throughout my academic terms, and continued
                to utilise. I used Microsoft documentation and forums to figure out issues I encountered with the Power
                Platform, and Stackoverflow whenever I had to resolve a custom code issue.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the technical side, I learned more languages, which were either similar to languages I
                previously knew from classes (C#, javascript), or were relatively straightforward to understand
                as I used them (HTML, CSS).

                        Web development was new, so I learned how to create a website on the job. The OPS uses the
                        Ontario Design System to standardise the appearance of OPS apps and websites, so I worked within
                        a standard guideline.

                Alongside the web development, I learned about accessibility standards for the internet. They are
                something I encountered and learned about for the first time on the job. These are technical guidelines
                and rules to improve the user experience for users with disabilities (physical or mental). They are
                known as the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Content_Accessibility_Guidelines">
                    Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (Wikipedia article).
                </a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Though I have worked on group projects in class, I believe I continued to learn more communication and
                collaboration skills on the job. All projects involved a team of four to six people, so I had to make
                sure I could communicate my ideas properly as well as understand and implement my coworkers' ideas.
                This job also involved communicating with clients, which included presenting completed work and taking
                notes on client feedback to implement it.
                Overall, collaboration and communication is something that I find to be a continuous learning process.
                Using these skills whenever possible helps improve them - practice is always useful.

                the same time, I had the privilege to work on multiple applications that will be and are used in
