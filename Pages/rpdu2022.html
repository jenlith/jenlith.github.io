            Abstract/Introduction
        </h2>
        <!-- Introduce reader to work: what you hope the takaway is. Short and to the point -->
        <p>
            From May to December 2022, I worked in the Rapid Prototype Design Unit (RPDU) within
            the Ontario Public Services (OPS). My work was primarily on low code applications,
            though there were also some custom code projects.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h2 id="about_employer">
            About the Employer
        </h2>
        <!-- Briefly Describe the employer & area of computing science that is related to
            this company/agency. Include interesting facts about the employer (people,
            locations, products, etc.) -->
        <p>
            The RPDU is a unit within the OPS, under the Ministry of Public and Business Service
            Delivery(MPBSD) (formerly the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services). The
            purpose of the unit is to deliver prototypes and applications using low code.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Low code" is a method of minimising the use of code when developing an application.
            It simplifies the process so that people with little or no experience with code
            can create their own application. For more experienced developers, it can be simpler
            to connect various resources together to create a more complex application.
            <br />
            In the RPDU, many applications were developed using this low code approach, using
            the resources and tools provided by the
            <a href="https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/en-ca/">
                Microsoft Power Platform (external site)
            </a>.
            Some examples of low code use include a World Cup charity "betting" application and
            a virtual signing application (Drop the Pen). Both applications take advantage of
            low code for rapid development with the user interface (UI, Power Apps) and backend functions (Power
            Automate, Dataverse).
        </p>
        <p>
            The RPDU encouraged co-op students to develop their GitHub profiles and personal
            portfolios to help improve their standing in applying for future jobs. There were
            also multiple events with a similar purpose in the larger Enterprise Technology
            Delivery (ETD) Division.
