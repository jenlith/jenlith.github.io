                    Within the RPDU, I worked primarily on two projects throughout the summer 2022 term:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        World Cup - an application using the Microsoft Power Platform

                        Blazor (HTML frontend and C# backend, with a Microsoft SQL server database)

                        <p>
                            Action Plan: Communicate with a client through various mediums (oral or written
                            communication routes) while developing the product, from start to finish.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Measure of Success: Final product completed and delivered (before the end of the S22
                            term). RPDU client satisfied with the product

                        <p>
                            Reflection: While projects were not completed, clients were satisfied with progress on 
                            both website (portal/intake service) and PowerApp (World Cup). There were regular meetings 
                            to review progress, and I took notes to ensure we would remember anything a client suggested 
                            or requested adding into the application being developed for them.

                            completed by the end of the term. I consider it a success, since it is near completion 
                            and I did not find myself at any roadblock for too long. I learned how to resolve any issues 
                            that occured in the application with relative ease, even customising the application with 
                            experience gained throughout the term with practice. Additionally, I was able to use Power 
                            Automate to enhance a service provided by the website since I was comfortable with creating 
                            Power Automate flows.

                            I consider this successful, as I continued daily standup meetings to stay on top of what 
                            needed to be worked on in the website. I also used that time to offer to help others where 
                            they needed assistance as I neared completion of what I took responsibility for. That way,
