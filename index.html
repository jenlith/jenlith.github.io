                        Within the RPDU, I worked primarily on two projects throughout the summer 2022 term:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>

                        <li>
                            Portal/Intake Service - a website using a custom code stack,
                            Blazor (HTML frontend and C# backend, with a Microsoft SQL server database)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    I also started a couple things towards the end of the term that continued into the fall 2022 term:

                                    way,
                                    I avoided having idle time that could be used more effectively.
